\opening{Dear Internship Coordinator,}

I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I am very interested in the
internship with the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine during the summer of 2018 (June-Aug 2018).
I have prior research experience in designing and implementing high performance (parallel and distributed) algorithms for
data mining. I have worked extensively on MPI and OpenMP. My work resulted in a number of publications which are listed in my CV.

I would like to use my experience and knowledge of HPC in Large Scale Genomic Applications.
I have always believed in doing research which directly benefits the people and society.The emerging paradigm of
patient-centered or personalized medicine will help the doctors in predicting and preventing diseases such as cancer, diabetes,
and various heart diseases.Being a part of this research, will help me directly have a positive impact on the lives of people.
Thank you for considering my application.I look forward to hear back from you.

Sincerely,

Dhruv Kumar\\
